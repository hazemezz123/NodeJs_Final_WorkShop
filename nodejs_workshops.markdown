### Instructions
Your task is to develop a Node.js application to manage a products database using CRUD operations.

Start by creating a new Node.js project and installing necessary dependencies such as MySQL, Nodemon, and Express. Set up a MySQL database named we-db with a products table containing the following columns: id, name, price, and description.

Connect the Node.js app to the database and implement the following APIs:
- Add Product: To insert new products into the database.
- Display All Products: To retrieve all products.
- Display Specific Product by ID: To retrieve a product by its ID.
- Update Product: To modify an existing product.
- Delete Product: To remove a product from the database.

Finally, test all the APIs to ensure they function correctly and return the expected results.

## Exercise O: Node.js 2

### Description
| Exercise | O |
|----------|---|
| Name | Node.js 2 |
| Outcomes and Performance Criteria | Understand how to interact with APIs using Postman. <br> Verify endpoints for CRUD operations. <br> Learn to validate response details using tests in Postman. |
| Skills | TPC3.1: Use a APIs <br> TPC3.3: Secure an application <br> TPC4.1: Create and maintain websites |
| Time Required | 30 mins |
| Tools needed | VS Code, Internet, Web Browser, Node.js App, Express.js |

### Instructions
Your task is to create a Node.js application using Express.

Start by installing Express and then create a file named index.js. In this file, define routes for the following pages:
- Home: The main landing page.
- About: Information about the application or company.
- Contact Us: A page with contact information.
- Products: A page to showcase available products.

Ensure each route renders the corresponding page when accessed. Finally, run the application to verify that the routes are working correctly and that the application functions as expected.
